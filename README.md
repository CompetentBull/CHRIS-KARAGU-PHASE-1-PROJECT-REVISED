# CHRIS-KARAGU-PHASE-1-PROJECT-REVISED
This project involves analysis of airplane accident rates (2018–2022) to determining which aircraft are the lowest risk #Business goal Support safe, cost-aware aircraft acquisition by identifying aircraft types associated with lower accident severity using historical accident records. #Data & preparation (summary) Dataset: 2,500 records, 8 columns (from 'flight.csv'). Cleaned by dropping an exported index column ('Unnamed: 0'), parsing 'acc_date' (6 invalid dates retained but excluded from year-based analysis), converting 'fat' to numeric (50 missing; severity rates computed only where fatalities are known, n=2,450), and mapping damage codes ('dmg') to readable categories (No/Minor/Substantial/Written off/Unknown/Missing). #Metrics Severity is approximated using: a. Fatal accident rate = 'AVG(is_fatal_strict)' where 'is_fatal_strict = 1' if 'fat > 0' else '0' b. Average fatalities per accident c. Damage category patterns #Key findings a. Ranking aircraft types (min 20 accidents/type, known fatalities only), the lowest-severity types were Airbus A320-214, Airbus A320-232, and Boeing 737-8AS (WL), each with 0% fatal accident rate in-sample. b. Damage level is strongly associated with severity: Written off accidents have a 52.23% fatal accident rate and 6.64 average fatalities, far higher than other damage categories. c. From 2018–2022, fatal accident rates ranged 14.6%–17.5% with no consistent trend; 2021 was highest. #Links a.
